# Tableau_crime-analysis
This project employed Tableau to develop interactive dashboards for analyzing crime data, aiding law enforcement in understanding crime patterns across time and geography. Through this work, I enhanced key data analytics skills such as time series analysis, geospatial mapping, and comparative visualization. I also gained hands-on experience in data storytelling, dashboard creation, and conveying complex insights in a clear, visual format. The project helped translate raw crime records into actionable intelligence for public safety planning and policy-making.
The analysis revealed that crimes like theft, battery, assault, and criminal damage are the most prevalent in the region, with high activity in specific districts and wards. Geo-mapping helped highlight crime hotspots, while time-series dashboards showed a noticeable decline in reported incidents from 2017 to 2022, suggesting positive trends in crime reduction. Temporal analysis highlighted that crime rates varied across different times of the day, with peak hours indicating higher risk periods. Comparative dashboards showed a significantly lower rate of arrests made, especially in 2019, raising concerns about enforcement effectiveness. Overall, the visualizations offered crucial insights for resource allocation and strategic intervention.
